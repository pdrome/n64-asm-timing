Code can be compiled using the bass assembler (by byuu).
I've used the version by ARM9 with MIPS/RSP/RDP output.

Special thanks to PeterLemon for his awesome N64 assembly library. It's a great learning tool and
a resource with lots of utility for better understanding the N64 hardware.

How to Compile:

All the code compiles into a single binary (ROMNAME.N64) file.
Using bass Run: make.bat
